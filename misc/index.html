            Alex Bertelli, Senior Reporter • March 18, 2025
        </p>
        <p>
            As a J2 student, journalism has shown me a lot about the community and my place within it. Previously shier
            and less involved beyond my own circles, this class has introduced me to new people, skills, and unique
            experiences that have shaped me as both a reporter and a person. I’ve grown fond of this program during my
            time here, and wish to step up as Online Editor to play my role in continuing the B’s legacy as a
            high-quality and informative publication. I believe my multidisciplinary experience, leadership and
            delegation skills, technical knowledge, and thoroughness make me a great fit to take on this responsibility
            in the coming year.
        </p>
        <div class="text-wrapper">
            <div class="carousel">
                <img src="./img1.png" class="carousel-image active">
                <img src="./img2.png" class="carousel-image">

                <button class="next" onclick="changeSlide(1)">&#10095;</button>
            </div>
            <p>
                Even since before journalism, one of my values as a writer has been dedication to the craft. I love
                digging deep into my topics — fiction or nonfiction — and searching for ways to add more intricate
                detail, nuance, or soul to the stories I write. My curiosity has drawn me towards profiles and features;
                my care for details of all sizes has compelled me to write thoroughly and with an eye for multiple
                different angles. Asking questions about the small details as well as the bigger picture has benefited
                me as a writer and editor; it’s what would enable me to most effectively feature other’s work and ensure
                the quality of our online pieces.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            While robotics has been a dual, sometimes competing force in my life, it’s also given me valuable experience
            leading underclassmen and keeping track of a variety of tasks over the course of many months. A co-lead and
            I led the freshman training program for this year, which involved delegating work, communicating with lots
            of people, and making sure tasks got completed with timeliness in pursuit of a long-term goal. Even more
            importantly, I formed strong relationships with new students that encouraged many to continue going with the
            club. Treating journalism with the same passion, I see multiple parallels: to be an effective Online Editor,
            I plan to strengthen bonds with existing and future journalism students; communicate with staffers to make
            sure they feel supported and can meet their deadlines; and make steady progress towards achievements like
            SNO distinction throughout the year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet another parallel is technical knowledge: I believe I am well-equipped to handle the website itself. In
            addition to background experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I have worked directly with the SNO web
            interface to put up crosswords and pre-publish them. Part of putting up the <a
                href="https://theburlingameb.org/9644/showcase/october-issue-crossword/">crosswords</a> on our website —
            even
            if a relatively minor thing — involved figuring out a way to embed custom code without breaking the
            display,
            hosting the puzzles on our <a href="https://theburlingameb.github.io/">Github</a> (created for this
            purpose!), and tailoring the UI to fit both our theme and the constraints of the site. My
            intentions were
            perhaps beyond the scope of wordpress, but it was that
            ambition and higher standard that drove me to problem-solve it regardless. I have this same sense of
            ambition towards our web displays and presentation — seeing the things Connie has done to make
            articles
            immersive inspires me to continue pushing the bounds of possibility, be it through integrating more
            interactive SNO elements or altogether blurring the line between story and experience.

        <p>
            More broadly, I’m pursuing Online Editor to continue learning and growing as a person. Part of why
            Journalism is so rewarding is because it pushes me past my comfort zone, often feeding me new problems and
            requiring me to adapt on the fly. I’ve dealt with my fair share of issues in the past — dubious angles,
            missing photos, elusive sources — and each brought with it a valuable lesson alongside practice resolving
            them in real time, whether that involved deep research, extensive communication, arranging and conducting
            interviews while out-of-country, or more. Being Online Editor would provide another unique opportunity to
            develop my skills and leadership, and I believe I have the responsibility to step up and give the role the
            dedication it deserves — to not only do it, but do it well.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a J2 student, journalism has shown me a lot about myself and who I want to be. In the past many months
            I’ve grown as a writer, page-designed, taken photos and made graphics, travelled far places to cover beats,
            and configured web displays for custom crossword puzzles. Going forward, I want to take on more
            responsibility as an Online Editor, combining my past experience and current ambitions to continue caring
            for our incredible website.
