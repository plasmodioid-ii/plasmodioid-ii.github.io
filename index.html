/**
 * The Exolve code creates only the following names at global scope:
 *
 * - Exolve
 * - createExolve
 * - createPuzzle (deprecated).
 * - exolvePuzzles
 *
 * - The most generic way to create a puzzle is with "new Exolve(...)".
 * - The createExolve() function is a covenient wrapper.
 * - The createExolve() function looks for and calls the function
 *       customizeExolve() if it exists (passing it the created puzzle).
 * - The createPuzzle() function is similar to createExolve(), and
 *       is deprecated (as the name may conflict with some other code).
 * - All HTML ids/class names begin with "xlv"
 */

/**
 * This is the global object in which *all* Exolve puzzles rendered on a single
 * web page are stored as properties, with the puzzle IDs being the keys.
 */
var exolvePuzzles;

/**
 * Constructor to create an Exolve puzzle.
 *
 * puzzleSpec is a string that contains the puzzle specs in the Exolve plain
 *     text format.
 * containerId is the optional HTML id of the container element in which you
 *     want to create this puzzle. If empty, the puzzle is created inside
 *     the element with id "exolve" if it exists (and its id is changed to
 *     exolve<N> in that case, where <N> is the index of this puzzle among
 *     all the pages on the page). If containerId is empty and there is no
 *     element with id "exolve", the puzzle is created at the end of the
 *     web page.
 * customizer is an optional function that will get called after the puzzle
 *     is set up. The Exolve object will be passed to the function.
 * provideStateUrl should be set to true if you also want to provide a URL
 *     that includes the current state and can be bookmarked or shared. Note
 *     that the puzzle state is always attempted to be saved in local storage.
 * visTop should be set to the height of any sticky/fixed position elements
 *     at the top of the page (normally just 0).
 * maxDim If non-zero, use this as the suggested max size of the container
 *    in px.
 * notTemp If false, state is not saved in local storage and some event
 *    listeners are not created. Useful for creating temporary/preview puzzles.
 *    Note that if you create a normal (notTemp=true) puzzle and your web page
 *    is going to destroy it for some reason during its normal course
 *    (ExolvePlayer does this, for example), then you should call destroy() on
 *    the puzzle object before removing all references to it. This will remove
 *    listeners for 'resize' and printing events, for example.
